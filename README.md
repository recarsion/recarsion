<summary><h3>ðŸš¶ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
<br>
I started as a Mechanical Engineer for an international automotive company. I was excited at first, thinking to myself that I got so lucky that I got into a good company right out of college. As time went on, the job was not fun anymore and it just became a routine for me to go work. There was no longer a challenge. After a year working there, I started a project hoping that it would make the job exciting again. It was a management system for our Maintenance Engineering team, to manage supplies and maintenance schedule. As the youngest in the team, I wanted it to be really modern and digital. So I started learning programming. As time went on, the project was going well, and at the same time, I was enjoying what I was doing. Then came new projects for me to <em>prioritize</em> on. The original project that was doing was forgotten. At that point, I knew that I would do a career shift. A few months of studying, I finally landed a job at a local start up. That was the start of everything. Now, I am developing my skills further, enjoying what I am doing, and trying to create awesome software.
